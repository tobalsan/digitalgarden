# Improving my vision
- 2023-06-30 08:22
	- ## First step: get rid of blur adaptation for my right eye
		- Get my right eye to full correction
			- Next contacts order -> right eye at 15.50 SPH
			- Arrange work setup to have clear vision with the right eye when looking at screen
			- Stay like this for a 3-4 weeks
	- ## 2nd step: start with differentials
		- Get differentials: after 3-4 weeks with comfortable work on the computer with full correction, order +1.5 glasses 
		- Wear the differentials for any close-up activity.
	- ## 3rd step: get normalized glasses
