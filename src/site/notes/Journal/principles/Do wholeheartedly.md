# Do wholeheartedly

Whatever you decide to do, focus on it. 
- Be in the present moment. 
- Focus on the process. 
- When you decide to do something, take the time do it well.
	- Even if you're just washing dishes, take the time do it well.
- Find joy in what you do, or spark it. Else, don't do it.
