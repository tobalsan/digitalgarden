# Don't force
Don't strain yourself doing things you don't enjoy doing.
Don't try to be someone you're not. 
Embrace who you are, and what comes to you naturally.
- Listen to your inner curiosity.
- Start with what comes easily.
- Don't force your idea of what you think should be, accept what is.
- Don't try to convince people.
- Don't try to justify yourself to anyone.
- Less is more. Don't add, subtract. Don't put in more hours, do less.
