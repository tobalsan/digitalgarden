# Just start
You saw a movie, heard a music, read a book and now you want to do it to. You sit down and want to write a movie script. Or write a hit song. No, it doesn't work like that.

Try that instead: **just start with the smallest idea**. Just a hint, a clue, a topic, a riff, a name. Pros prototype[^1].
- **Creation starts like an embryo**. Just look at nature. Do humans appear fully grown? No, it starts with the smallest possible element. And then it grows from it. An idea isn't a finished piece. It's just a seed. Your canvas, blank page, recording device, is the ground.
- **You have to plant the seed into the ground**. Then tend to it, care for it, and water your plant. Let it grow, over time, by taking care of it regularly. And one day you'll have a fully grown creation. That's how you get to it. Not in an instant. Not quickly.
- Don't forget to add fertilizer to your ground: take care of your workspace and your creation tools.
- **So just get started. Don't complicate things**, simply plant your tiny seed, and tend to it regularly.
