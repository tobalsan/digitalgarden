# Unlock reading with non-linearity

If you want to read more but can't seem to get yourself to do it, try this.

We can simply unlock our reading by accepting that it's also a non-linear process, just like writing.
- Why would we have to read one book at a time, in order, chapter after chapter, reading every single word and in big chunks?
- No, follow your curiosity instead. Read the bits you find interesting.
- You can read a single sentence if you want.
- No order. Go through what attracts you. Skip entire parts.
- Do it just like you want to do it, free of any rule, only led by curiosity and enjoyment.
