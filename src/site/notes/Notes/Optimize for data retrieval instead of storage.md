# Optimize for data retrieval instead of storage
## Ditch the tags
Too often we instinctively focus on data storage. We like putting:
- labels
- categories
- tags 

Thinking that it's a nice way to store the data and that will help us retrieve it easily. In reality, this exactly the opposite: classifying data this way impedes easy retrieval. That's because our brain do not work like computers or file cabinets. It works by [[association\|association]], [[linking things\|linking things]], and [[Notes/It is context that makes things matter\|context]]. 

[[Notes/How the humain brain works\|How the humain brain works]].

So rather than classifying things using labels to distinguish them, favor linking, associating concepts, sparking connections, unearthing similarities, and how to resurface content regularly ([[repeated exposure\|repeated exposure]]).
