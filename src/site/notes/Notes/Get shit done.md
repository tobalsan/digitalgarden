# On finding ideas and just getting shit done

Up until I've been going through the same dead end process: I would sit down, by myself, and start to think and try to come up with a good business idea. And I would usually end up thinking about it for ages, [[Notes/Overthinking kills momentum\|overthinking]], either fantasizing about it or discouraging myself, but never doing anything about it.

- Now I think this process is flawed right from the start. You can't *think up* of a good idea. That’s one of the [[Notes/Things we do backwards MoC\|Things we do backwards MoC]].
- It starts with *interactions* with the world and others. You need to experience reality and real-world situations and problems. [[Notes/Align with reality\|Align with reality]]. And then, from these experiences in the real world, you discover real needs and problems that you can come up with solutions.
- Anything else is *wishful thinking*, building a key and trying to find a lock for it.

I'm composing music right now using Logic Pro X on my Mac. I was about to check out a video on YouTube for mic placement when I suddenly remembered when I used to create music back in the 2000's in my garage. *I had no internet connection*. That was an unintended but crazy effective way to have focused and productive sessions. Rather than wasting time listening to others talk I was actually creating stuff.
