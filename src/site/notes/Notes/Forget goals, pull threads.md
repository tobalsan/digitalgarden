# Forget goals, pull threads
Life (mostly) [[Notes/Fixating on the way to do something\|does not occur by goals]]. Anything that's not trivial rarely gets reached by a carefully crafted plan. Life unravels like a thread. You have to [[Notes/Stop trying hard to make friends\|Stop trying hard to make friends]] and [[Notes/Try other angles\|Try other angles]].

Interesting things happen in life when you start [[Notes/Sometimes it’s just about goofin’ around\|goofing around]], pulling a thread, and following where it leads, [[Notes/To keep going, you must do what is fun and enjoyable\|following your curiosity]]. 
When you don't have any pre conceived plan or [[Notes/Goals trap you in tunnel vision\|end goal]]. 

It also takes off the burden of big [achievement|accomplishment]. Just follow your curiosity and start pulling threads. See where it leads you. If you get bored, drop the thread. If you are interested, keep going.
