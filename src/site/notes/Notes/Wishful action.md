# Wishful action
Want do = doesn't exist. It's bullshit. 
It's either do, or do not, but want do is do not disguised in do. It's mental masturbation. Everlasting fantasy. *Wishful thinking*. 

What's worst is that having a lot of things you want to do clutters your mind. Paradoxically, wanting to do a lot of things paralyzes you. It stifles momentum.
If you have a backlog of things to do a mile long, this could be the very reason you feel—and are—unproductive.

Free yourself by releasing all you want to do. By freeing your mental load of all the things you think you should or want to do, you'll actually free up the resources and drive to do what actually matters. 

Choose [[Notes/Effectiveness\|Effectiveness]] instead of spreading yourself thin.
