# How do you feel about the goals you set in your mind
I keep reading either you're supposed to set clear goals and focus on them, or let go of objectives altogether, not trying, and be effortless.  Well, maybe the two aren't incompatible. They're not opposite sides of which you have to pick one.

Our subconscious holds the power, and since it is influenced by emotion, the key might be to realise how the goals you set make you truly feel. 
- Are you enthusiastic about them, do they make you feel excited? Or do they make you anxious and frustrated? This is probably the key difference:
- Whether what you aim for makes you happy or miserable right now, it will influence your subconscious that way, thus making you either actually achieving or avoiding it.

The more remote a goal is the greater the chances it'll make you frustrated instead of excited. That's why choosing to do something you can achieve now leads to results and growth more often than aiming for overly ambitious goals. Close to achieving = excitement, far away achievement = frustration.

Go for the interesting, the exciting, what makes you happy now. What makes you miserable isn't sustainable.
