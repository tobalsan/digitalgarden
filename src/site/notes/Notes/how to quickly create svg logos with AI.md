# How To Quickly Create SVG Logos With AI

The best way to get a great logo is to design it yourself or hire a designer to do it.

The second best way is to ask AI to do it for you.
- I suggest using [Midjourney](), just works and produces beautiful results.
- Use the following prompt:
	> an SVG vector image of [insert description], white background, logo** 
- Some examples:
	- SVG logo with the text "SuperCompany", modern, elegant, black and purple, white background
	- an SVG vector image of a sleek logo, bright colors, flat design, white background, with a roaring bear
- Upscale your preferred result, download as PNG.
- Go to [Vectorizer.AI](https://vectorizer.ai/) (it's free while in beta), upload your PNG, just go with the default settings, and download the resulting SVG.
- Bonus: if you want to change the colors of your logo, use [Canva]() or [Adobe Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/fr/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html)
