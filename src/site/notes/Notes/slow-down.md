# Slow Down
### Slow down

• Slow down when you observe and listen, to get perspective.
• Slow down to notice and write down what sucks.
• Slow down when you absorb data.
• Slow down when you talk.
• Slow down when you do something.

### Uncross your fingers

• Do not assume, do not hope.
• Know the data, the facts.
• Test, run experiments and collect feedback.

### Get inspired by the world around you

• Copy.
• Transform
• Combine.
