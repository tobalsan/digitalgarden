# Create Virtuous Cycles For Your Goals
Achieving goals makes you believe you can achieve goals which in turns makes you achieving more goals. It’s a virtuous circle.

- How can you leverage this? By setting small goals and achieving them. [[Notes/Start small\|Start small]].
- Setting big goals at the outset is counterproductive because you’re likely to feel discouraged, fail and [[helplessness\|start learning helplessness]], which in turn makes you less motivated and less likely to achieve other goals. It’s a vicious circle.
- When you set small goals and achieve them, you grow from there, and you start the virtuous circle.
- Pick a simple goal, and achieve it. Then do it again, with a little bigger goal. Repeat.
