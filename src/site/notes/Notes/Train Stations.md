# Train Stations

A train brought you on on your first station.
You spent a lot of time in that station, you parents were there, and your siblings.
But once you grew up, you took another train, and it led you to another station.

Throughout your life, you keep taking trains, and arriving at different stations.
Some trains you don't have the choice to take. Others, you decided.
Some stations happened to be awesome. Some others less so. 
You end up staying a few weeks in certain stations, months in others. There a few stations at which you stay for years. 
Somehow your appreciation of the station isn't necessarily linked to the time you spent there, and you might spend years in a station you don't really enjoy.

The thing is that in most stations, trains come and go all the the time. They look different, and lead to different stations. Naturally, you try to take the better looking trains, the ones who look like they'll bring you to the best station next. The trick is that you never can tell for sure which station a train will lead you to, no matter how it looks. You can guess, and make assumptions based on pattern recognition and probabilities, but it's never a 100% sure thing. 

Surprisingly, many times when you thought a train would lead you to a great station, it didn't. And other times, when you thought you took the wrong train, it led you to a wonderful station.

For almost all my adult life, I've been so obsessed over catching the perfect train that I ended up missing so many others. I was certain I knew what the right train for me looked like, and thus I completely ignored those that didn't look like what I had in mind. 
Yet each time I embarked in the trains that looked like they were the ones, I didn't end up in the right stations.
From time to time though, I'd embark on a train just for fun. I didn't really care about how the train looked, I was just curious. These were the trains that led me to the best stations I went to in my life.

Until the last train comes.
