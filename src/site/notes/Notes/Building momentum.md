# Building momentum
## **Snowball. Quick wins** 
How do you grow every day? How are you improving, doing and learning new things? Everyday lately seems like stagnation = might as well be dead.
Life is evolution. If you can find a way to improve, even the tiniest win, every day, you're alive.
Think of a snowball. It starts small, but every inch it moves it grows. 
It's the quick wins that add up in the end. Not aiming for the big win right at the onset.

## S.C.M.: simplicity, confidence, momentum
No matter what you do, you can improve by following simplicity, confidence, and momentum.
[[Start small\|Start small]] and simple, don't go to big, don't overcomplicate stuff in the beginning.
Build Confidence, by getting small victories and keeping having fun.
Harness momentum, to slowly grow bigger and doing more complex stuff.
Remember to iterate and reflect. See [[Act fast, then take the time to reflect\|Act fast, then take the time to reflect]]
