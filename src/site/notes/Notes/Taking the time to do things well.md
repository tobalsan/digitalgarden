# Taking the time to do things well
What is of the utmost importance is to do things right. The results are irrelevant if you do things right. All that matters is the present moment. Are you focusing 100% on your art as you are doing it? Are you pouring your heart and soul into execution?

And to do things right, one must take his time. When you do anything with a result in mind, you are not present focused. You are future—and result—oriented, and this leads you to hurry. Being focused on the result will make you rush. It's [[Notes/When you should not want to be doing things\|When you should not want to be doing things]], which then makes it muche harder, if not impossible, to do things right.

Just like life is to be lived for itself, because there are no reward after the finish line, so should your actions be done for themselves, and not for a reward. This is the essence of doing things right. Do things for the sake of doing them well.

That’s why you want to take your time when doing things. Doing things in a rush, in hope to get things done, just for the result, is the opposite of doing things well.

Marcus Aurelius, in [[Notes/Emperor of Rome Marcus Aurelius et George Long - Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius\|his meditations]], advise that when you choose to do something, *do it like it is the last thing you're doing before you die*, so you don't put too much pressure on yourself, and don't do things just in expectation of a result. It makes you detached from the end goal, and be in the [[Notes/Joy is in the present moment\|present moment]].

Taking your time is not just for the task at hand, but also in the longer run. It's understanding that many things can't be done at once, but rather in continuity and consistency of action over a certain period of time. Rather than rushing to be done or attain a goal, you are [[Notes/You don't have to spend hours on each task\|You don't have to spend hours on each task]]. 
Besides, spending just a bit of time on a task makes it more likely that you'll keep doing it over a longer period of time, instead of burning out in frustration because you tried to go faster than what was adequate.

In fact, when you [[Notes/Slow down\|Slow down]], you often end up faster, as Ventakesh Rao explains in [[Notes/Venkatesh Rao - Tempo\|Tempo]].
