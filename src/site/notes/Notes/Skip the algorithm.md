# Skip the algorithm
Maybe at the beginning of internet, up until 2005, it made sense to browse stuff randomly and haphazardly, because content was scarce and that was better for serendipity. 

But nowadays the internet is so saturated with noise, overwhelming and flooding with content. Plus there are algorithms—that weren't there back then—to provide you with content similar to what you've started browsing.

Consuming news feeds, walls, and all content suggested by algorithms might be weakening your brain's ability to focus, capacity for attention, and [[Notes/Beware of demanding to be fed with answers\|critical thought]].
