# 3 picks this week
## **A bit of motivation**

_Don't worry I won't get into a 3720-word blog post on how to get motivated._

In two days it's the end of the confinement in France. I stumbled upon this picture on Reddit. It's good to remind ourselves that whatever we think of doing, we just need to start. Everything else is an excuse.

## **Beautiful music to listen while working**

Do you like melodic, classical music? Here's a beautiful instrumental song that mixes classical, irish folk, and video game genres. Perfect for working or chilling. If you like this style, check out [Celestial Aeon Project on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3erL8NEQbmmOXhO6yyVWxO?si=YQ30aKlISxmke2fS8Zeglw).

## **WordPress is overrated**

A couple weeks ago I started playing with [Grav](https://getgrav.org/). This very website is made with it. _December 2020 update: Not anymore. This website is now powered by [Ghost](http://ghost.org/)_.

It's a small CMS I enjoy because it relies on flat files rather than a database. So it's simple to install and use. And it's **fast**.

The two features that sold me:

- You can write your posts in Markdown.
- It's not completely _just files_. It still has a plugin ecosystem. There's an underlying base in PHP and Twig. So if you know how to code with these languages, it's perfect. And since I have 10 years of experience in Symfony development (which happen to use PHP and Twig), you can understand why I chose it.
