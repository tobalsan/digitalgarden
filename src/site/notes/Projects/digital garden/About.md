Hi there!

I am Thinh, I currently live in Montingy-Les-Cormeilles. It's a town in the suburbs of Paris, France.

Currently, my day job consists in doing freelance development for [Cloudi-Fi](https://www.cloudi-fi.com/?target=_blank), a french startup. Most of the work is on PHP development with the [Symfony framework](https://www.symfony.com/?target=_blank).

I also learn Ruby recently and starting to fall in love with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/?target=_blank).

These days, once I'm done with the day job, I'm making stuff: either creating no-code apps (as odd as it might sound for someone who's been coding for the last decade), writing whatever I feel like writing (which might end up on this website), or making music.

Oh, about this website? as the title says, it's just stuff I find interesting, and want to share.
