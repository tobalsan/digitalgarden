(This is a now page, and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about?target=_blank), too.)

I just moved in a new home by mid-August. It's a 110m² 4-bedroom house in Montigny-Les-Cormeilles, France, in the suburbs of Paris. I was previously living in a 42m² apartment, so it's a nice upgrade.

During the day, I work at [Cloudi-Fi](https://www.cloudi-fi.com/?target=_blank), a french startup that provides custom, easy-to-use guest Wi-Fi solutions.

I'm getting a bit more involved in cryptocurrencies, I just started investing on [Coinbase Pro](http://pro.coinbase.com/?target=_blank).

Other than that, I write content, when I feel like doing so, here and on my french blog [Tobal.fr](https://tobal.fr/blog?target=_blank).

I'm also interested in acquiring a new website, so if you know someone selling one, please put us in touch!
