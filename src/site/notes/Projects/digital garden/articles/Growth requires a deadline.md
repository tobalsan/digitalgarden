# Growth requires a deadline
Isn't it funny how it's often projects with a clear deadline are kept alive and going, while project without deadlines often go nowhere and end up dead. 
I'm not necessarily talking about professional projects, although it applies there too. 
But with personal projects, it's quite clear. Which project do you think is more likely to get somewhere: *Lose weight* or *Lose weight in the next 6 months*. 
Having no deadline invite vague goals, overthinking, procrastination, perpetual delaying, confusion.
Having a deadline [[Projects/digital garden/articles/You cannot iterate in a vacuum\|applies constraints, forces you to be specific, to reassess, and iterate]].

Life itself not only has a deadline, but has deadlines all along. Your cells die, you shed skin, everything in your body dies to make room for the new stuff. That's how you grow. 

Without deadline, no iteration is possible. If your project or creation is in a perpetual draft state, it will never be done. If it's not done, it can't be improved upon.

Are you uncomfortable with a deadline? Good, that means it fills its purpose: it's forcing you to get real. You see, not having a deadline is comfortable, you can say to yourself that you'll find the time and resources to "get things done properly". But that's a lie you tell yourself. As I wrote above, no deadline leads to delaying eternally. Perfectionism is fear in disguise. Having no deadline allows to avoid shipping in the guise of perfectionism. That's why deadlines are uncomfortable. They force you to get real and pragmatic.

What if you keep missing your deadlines? Either you must reassess how you set deadline, or, like in my case, you must learn to be specific about what *Done* means and abide by it.
