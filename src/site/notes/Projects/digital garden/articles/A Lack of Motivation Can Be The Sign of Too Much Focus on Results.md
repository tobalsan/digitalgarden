# A Lack of Motivation Can Be The Sign of Too Much Focus on Results

There's something you should do.
But you can't muster the motivation to do it.
Think about it for a second. Think about that thing you set out to do. 

**Is it something you want to do, or you want to be done?**

It's a huge difference. Something you want to do is exciting and you have no problem finding motivation for.

Something you want done, on the other hand... Well, if you're like me, most of things you have to do are things you need to be done. That's just how it is, how we usually go on about life without thinking about it too much.

That's fine. Most often, you can't always do just what you really want to do. But then, if you're not motivated, maybe it's because the reward for doing what you want to be done is not worth enough to you. Maybe it's not meaningful enough. Not fulfilling enough. Just not giving you enough incentive to do what you think you ought to do. 

Again, that's fine. But then, my question is: **why the hell did you set out to do that thing in the first place? If it's something unexciting, and even the result of you effort isn't appealing enough, why are you even considering doing it?**

Maybe it is because you—very remotely—connect this thing you have to do with some assumed, if not imaginary, progress or accomplishment. But this distant accomplishment isn't tangible enough. [[_Notes/What you think you need might not be what you really need\|What you think you need might not be what you really need]]. It isn't real or strong enough, it's just [[_Notes/Wishful action\|Wishful action]].

I believe that's the root of the problem: **we plan what we're going to do based on wishful thinking**. We set out to pursue endeavors just because we think they might bring you closer to one distant goal, regardless of how we feel about doing those things, and regardless of how concrete or real the progress or result we'll achieve will be.

It helps to pause and truly reflect on why you want to do what you set out to do, but find hard to motivate yourself about doing. [[_Notes/Spend time in reflection every day\|Spend time in reflection every day]].
