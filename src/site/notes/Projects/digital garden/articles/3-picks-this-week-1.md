# 3 picks this week
## **Tired of being distracted by Slack?**

On the forum of a [community](https://makerpad.co/?target=_blank) I recently joined, someone talked about Slack's principal inconvience, which is that it quickly can become a nefarious distraction to your work. An interesting alternative that has been proposed was **Yac**.

I haven't tried it but I find it appealing, as the app's main feature is being asynchronous. This means you get to leave video messages and people watch it when they can. You get the benefit or image and sound without the necessity to interact in real-time. I like the idea.

[Yac | Eliminate meetings with voice messages

Asynchronous Meetings, Voice Messaging, and Screen Sharing for Teams.

## **I wish I had read this 10 years ago**

Lately, I've been learning Ruby, and the [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/?target=_blank) framework. After ten years of PHP web development, using [Symfony](https://symfony.com/?target=_blank), I find myself wishing I had started with Ruby on Rails instead. What draws me to Ruby On Rails is not the features the language and framework offer, but the philosophy behind it.

It's so clear and prominent that they have a dedicated page about it called **The Rails Doctrine**. I strongly encourage you to read it. Even if you're not a developer. The concepts described apply more generally to anyone who cares about doing the right things and being effective. Whether you are a manager, an entrepreneur, a craftsman or a student, it's a fantastic resource and reminder of the importance of staying pragmatic.

[Doctrine

A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## **I made this without writing code**

And finally, a little website I've had fun creating without any code. As I said in the beginning of this post, I recently joined a community advocating the creation of websites and apps without writing a single line of code. You may have heard it lately, and it's true: in 2020 you don't need to know how to code to build (almost) any kind of website or mobile app. You've got no excuse.

Check my app, it's a simple website that asks you 6 questions to know what you're doing these days, and then displays your answers to the internet.

_I removed the link because I didn't renew the domain name._
