# Books To Read This Summer
Just a short list of books I've read in the past, along with a small comment to give you some context, and an idea of what the book is about.

- [_How To Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big_](https://amzn.to/3hwMWQf) by [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams). A collection of practical advice on life and business, based on the life story of the author. Since he's a cartoonist, expect having fun reading it.
- [_The 80/20 Principle_](https://amzn.to/38LYivH) by [Richard Koch](https://richardkoch.net/). A classic. Even if you know the 80/20 concept, I highly recommend reading it. It's both an eye opener and a refresher of how much resources (mostly time and energy) we waste without being aware.
- [_Skin in the Game_](https://amzn.to/3aSoXtn) by [Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb). Our world is filled with randomness, and bullshit. This book is the ultimate guide to navigating such a world.
- [_Blink_](https://amzn.to/3aVFQmV) by [Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/). What is intuition? What exactly happens when we follow our guts? Is it always the right thing to do? Read the book to get amazed by surprising and profound answers.
- [_Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned_](https://amzn.to/2L4gWqm)by Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman. Compared to the previous best-sellers, this book is quite unknown. Yet, I think it points out a radical truth: goals are bullshit (most of the time).

**Bonus**, if you're into cosmology, quantum physics and philosophy:

- [_The Fabric of Reality_](https://amzn.to/2KONaWS) by [David Deutsch](https://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/). This book talks about problem-solving, epistemology, virtual reality, evolution, quantum physics and computers, time travel, and life. Not a light book you pick up on a whim, but if you're into these subjects, it's captivating.
