# Entry Triggers

> [!warning] IMPORTANT NOTICE BEFORE USING THESE TRIGGERS
> These triggers are provided out of context, which means they are not to be used in isolation.
> They only are a tool to find an entry once a clear context has been established and the Draw On Liquidity has been determined.
## Displacement back into the range
### Prerequisites
- Price has formed a range and you outlined the range high and low on the 1H or 15m chart.
- Price breaks out of the range, sweeping a previous liquidity pool (or SMT), but shows inability to break away from the range.
- It returns inside the range **with  displacement**.
- Variation: return into the range with strength.
	- Price returns **quickly** into the range, i.e. within 10m, and does so without displacement but with clear strength, with tall candles, CISD+FVG, creating Orderblocks, RDRB, or immediate rebalancing.
### Entry
- **Entry on strength**: enter on the confirmation of displacement, i.e. when the displacement candle closes back inside the range. For the variation, enter on the immediate rebalance, or with a stop market order when price goes past the previous wick, effectively creating an RDRB.
- **Entry on confirmation**: enter when price tests the FVG formed by the displacement.
### Stop placement
- Place SL above the displacement (first FVG candle high/low).
- Variation: place SL behind the last immediate rebalance or RDRB.
- The most important is that the SL should be **outside of the range**.

## High Probability Orderblock
### Prerequisites
- Price must be trending on the LTF, i.e. Order Flow has been clearly established on LTF with any of the following: displacement candles, FVGs, runaway gaps, validated OBs.
- Price just crated an Orderblock followed by an FVG in close proximity (within the next 5 candles).
- Price hasn't reached an LTF liquidity pool yet, i.e. the OB and FVG formation should be before or after a previous swing. The FVG displacement should *not* have been a raid on a previous high/low.
### Entry
- **Aggressive entry**: enter on the displacement FVG C.E.
- **Higher R:R entry**: enter on the OB.

*Multiple or overlapping Orderblocks: which one to use?*
Use the highest point that is under the 0.5 level of aggregate FVG.
### Stop placement
Place SL behind the used OB.

## Breaker Block
### Prerequisites
- Price must not have swept opposite liquidity to the Breaker Block (e.g. on a Bullish Breaker formation, the swing that created the Breaker Block must not have run LTF BSL).
### Entry
- Enter on the Bullish Breaker Block high / Bearish Breaker Block low.
### Stop placement
Place SL behind the Breaker Block.
**Price must quickly move away from the Breaker Block**.  If price meanders around the Breaker Block, it becomes low probability.
### Example
Unicorn setup.
