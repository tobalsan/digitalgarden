# Sprint vs Marathon
We tend to treat life decisions like sprints when life is really a marathon. 
That's what makes us have bursts of efforts and then burn out.

Almost [[_Notes/How to change\|every improvement in life happens over time]], in the long run, as opposed to overnight changes.

The person who wants to become fit and starts with two hours of running every day quits after a couple weeks. The one that starts with a brisk walk 2 or 3 times a week ends up doing it for months and soon progresses to running on a regular basis. 

We choose sprint decisions over marathon ones because we focus on results, instead of focusing on [[_Notes/Improvement over results\|Improvement over results]]. Making marathon decisions lets us build consistency.
Marathon decisions let you do [[_Notes/A little every day\|A little every day]].

**The key is in focusing on progress instead of results**.
Improvement over a still rosy picture.
