# Sometimes it’s just about goofin’ around
Once in Youtube video, there was this guy who played guitar with his feet. He was incredible, playing better than most people can play with their hands. But did he set out to be a master of guitar with his feet? Not at all. In his own words, he just started "goofin' around."

How many great entrepreneurs, companies, athletes, pro musician, started goofin' around?

Starting with the burden of doing something grandiose at the onset is putting up with unecessary difficulty.
