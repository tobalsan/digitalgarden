# Stop fighting uphill battles

Stop choosing losing positions. Choose the high ground.

Insanity is keeping doing the same thing and expecting a different result. It's also trying hard while odds are against you, and hoping for the unlikely.
Choose what comes to you naturally and easily. Have fun.
It's not about only doing what is inherently easy. It's about finding a easy way to achieve what you want to do.

In the end, it's not just about doing the right thing. **It's about making it easy and fun to do the right thing**.
