# What makes a day successful
- **Freedom**: to do what you want, when you want, how you want/
- **Time**: taking your time in every moment, being present.
- **Enjoyment**: do what you're interested in, what you're excited about.
- **Growth**: improve in whatever you do, become better than yesterday.
