# You don't want to be doing things out of anxiety, fear, need or obligation
I've been doing this way too many times:
- Trying to network because I was feeling lonely.
- Trying to start projects or find ideas because I was chasing money.
- Trying to create content because I was after popularity. 

None of these are about [[Resources/MoCs/On the process MoC\|the process]]. They're 100% after an [[_Notes/The foolishness of doing things out of desire\|end result]]. They seek to be done rather than doing. It's the difference of mindset between amateurs and pros. [[_Notes/Pros fail like amateurs, but with one difference\|Pros fail like amateurs, but with one difference]].

Again on [[Journal/entries/1. Daily Notes/2022/08/2022-08-10\|2022-08-10]], I caught myself looking first at charts, then social media, with that feeling of inadequacy, like *I had to do something*. I felt envy, frustration, and lacking what others seem to have. It's the exact moment when you start trying hard. And it's possibly the worst state of mind in which to do things. It is doing things from a scarcity mindset standpoint, instead of an abundance one.
