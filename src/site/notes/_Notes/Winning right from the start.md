# Winning right from the start

It dawn on me that what I started doing for fun and enjoying quickly turned into stressful, frustrating and worrying occupations, just because I started setting arbitrary objectives out of my control.
- Learning to play poker well suddenly became winning tournaments.
- Trying playing with crypto turned into having to make a sizeable profit everyday.
So yeah, lots of frustration, anger, and sense of [[helplessness\|powerlessness]] because I started having visions of grandeur and deluding myself thinking that reaching those would easily be attainable.

Acronyms I came up with:
- Put yourself on the **LINE**: Go for [[_Notes/On learning\|learning]], the Interesting, the Novelty, and [[_Notes/Balance your effort with enjoyment\|Enjoyment/Exciting]].
- Be **AWESOME**: be Already Winning by Enjoying(Embracing?) Simple Objectives and [[Managing expectations\|Managing expectations]].

In essence, win the moment you [[_Notes/Taking Action MoC\|take action]]. **Like nature, meet your [[_Notes/Don't try - objectives do rarely work\|objective]]—or rather, constraint— right from the start and go from there**, finding various, new, and interesting ways of meeting that constraint. Note here there's no longing, no [[_Notes/The foolishness of doing things out of desire\|aching for reaching a distant goal]]. When the objective is simply to take action, you can start [[_Notes/Tinkering\|Tinkering]],  The goal is accomplished right from the start.
