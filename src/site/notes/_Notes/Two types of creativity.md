# Two types of creativity
- **Fantasy creativity**: spending time imagining scenarios led by our desires, shaping a picture of the world as it would be if it was conforming to our wishes. This makes us spend most of our time and energy interpreting reality to conform to our desires
- **Curious creativity**: following our curiosity, exploring, wondering about the world and what is or could be, without judgment. This makes us fully embrace reality and interact with it.
