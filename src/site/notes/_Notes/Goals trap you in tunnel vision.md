# Goals trap you in tunnel vision
The problem when being setting goal, or even just desiring intensely something is two-fold:
- It gives you tunnel vision. It makes you [[_Notes/Fixating on the way to do something\|Fixating on the way to do something]]. It prevents you from using what you have know. It precludes [[_Notes/Tinkering\|Tinkering]] and discovery (of things apparently unrelated to your goal). Because in reality, life, and how things and events unfold and linked to each other are too complex for you to know in advance what will be useful. Aiming at a distant goal makes you focus on what you don't have or can't do, instead of seeing what is available to you and you can do now.
- It makes you impatient. You want things _now_. Thus, it closes your mind. You think it's either now or never. But most things come with time. You have to keep open loops, to be on the lookout both consciously and subconsciously.
### Is it always wrong to have goals and think of the future then?
No, only when you haven't started anything, when you have nothing going on. If you're working on something that has already some momentum, it can be good to aim for goal and plan ahead. Because you have substance, something as reference and to act on.
### Stop postponing the good stuff. What's exciting or cool that can you do _now_?
"I'll do this when I'll have x $ or x visitors or enough time or the right conditions..." Quit delaying stuff. Quit waiting for a hypothetical, wishful, ideal situation to make things happen. Deal with your situation as it is *now*.
