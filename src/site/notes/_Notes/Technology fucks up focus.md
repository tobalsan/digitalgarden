# Technology fucks up focus
[[_Notes/On focus\|Focus]], the power of concentration, is arguably one of the most important requirements to live a fulfilling life.
It is nothing less than the control of one’s mind. 
If you can't focus, you are not in control of your mind. Someone or something else is.

Yet, in our era, almost everything around us is a hindrance to the controlling of our mind. 
The smartphone is the main culprit, with the **information overload**: the constant nagging of notifications, the immediate availability of information and entertainment a mere taps away, the never ending flood of content, suggestions, apps, and recommendations. 

And this is not only the smartphone. Everything that grabs our attention, saps our ability to focus, and insidiously become part of us as **habits**.
