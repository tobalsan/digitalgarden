# You have to believe in what you do
What you believe is what ends up to be. What if you believed your writing was heavily anticipated, and cheered upon, and it delighted people? What kind of impact would it have on your energy, motivation and output?

That might be the secret of _Fake it until you make it_. When you bring so much energy to what you do, because of what you believe, that reality ends up aligning with your belief.
It's not about believing that what you do is fantastic and grandiose. It's about believing in the value you are prodiving. If you believe you're helping others out, it will generate a lot of energy, and this energy is contagious. 

If you try to convince others but you aren't even truly convinced yourself, you won't be convincing. Actually, when you truly believe something, you don't feel the need to convince others. This will happen by itself. Why would you have to convince someone of something that's obviously true?

But of course, you can't force yourself to arbitrarily believe in things. So maybe it's time you stop doing things you don't believe, and start doing what you believe in.
