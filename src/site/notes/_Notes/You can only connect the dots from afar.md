# You can only connect the dots from afar
Don't try to connect the dots right from the start. When you start, pick one dot and __follow the path__ where it leads you. You can't get the whole picture where you are now. But once you started, and kept going, picked up a few clues here and there, at some point you'll be at a higher place, from where you'll be able to connect the dots.
