# Thinking in bets
Put yourself in situations where you're at an advantage. Play games you're likely to win. Engage when you have an edge, when the odds are in your favour. **Be the casino, not the gambler**.

So much frustration and wasted efforts come from putting ourselves in situations where we're at a disadvantage. Fighting uphill battles. Going against the flow, against our natural drives.
Forcing ourselves into doing things we don't want to do.
Using all of our limited willpower because of a wrong environment.
