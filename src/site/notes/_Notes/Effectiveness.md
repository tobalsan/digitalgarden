# Effectiveness
If you are constantly rushing through life, it's probably because you feel [[_Notes/Your time on earth is limited\|Time is scarce]]. But this denotes a lack of effectiveness, because if you're effective, you have all the time in the world. And there's no need to rush if you have time.

This thought came to me while I was brushing my teeth, and feeling already behind time for the day. 
## Mental laziness
Spending hours working could be a sign of mental laziness. 
You don't take the time to properly think about what is it you want to achieve. 
You don't take the time to reflect on what you've already done and link it to your next endeavor.
Thus you do *empty moves*. You repeat previous behavior and mistakes. You don't [[_Notes/Things get accomplished by iteration\|iterate]].
And so after a while, you feel exhausted, frustrated, depressed, because despite putting in countless hours, despite great effort, you burn out, and give up.

That's because being effective requires more that intensity. Approaching things solely with intensity leads to [[_Notes/Trying hard\|Trying hard]]. Intensity must be preceded with intentionality and followed by [[_Notes/Act fast, then take the time to reflect\|reflection]].
## Intention
Effectiveness starts with intention. 
You must be intentional in what you do to know what you want out of your effort.
If you don't know what is the fruit of your efforts look like, how are you going to get it?
## Reflection
Then it requires reflection. Taking time to assess what your actions led to.
[[_Notes/Spend time in reflection every day\|Spend time in reflection every day]].

This is the essence of *Pareto's Law* and *Parkinson's Law*. 
If you're not effective, you feel like you need ages to accomplish anything, and you always feel you don't have enough time.
If you're effective, you don't need to spend inordinate amounts of time on the things you do. You do less, but better. So once again, *Less Is More*.
