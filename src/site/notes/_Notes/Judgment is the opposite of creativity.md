# Judgment is the opposite of creativity
Creativity is about making connections. And making connections requires curiosity and openness. 
Judging does exactly the opposite: it classifies, catalogues. It's the opposite of openness. When you judge you are closed. You immediately file whatever you see in a category, assimilating it to the known, without letting it lead you to the unknown.
