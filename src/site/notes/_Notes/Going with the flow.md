# Going with the flow
## Harness you natural drives
Why fighting your natural inclinations? Use them at your advantage. Use motivational jiu-jitsu.

Set up your environment so doing the right thing is super easy to do:
 - When you're not hungry, fill your cabinet with healthy food if you want to diet. 
 - Have your sport clothes ready before you think of working out.

Make whatever first step you need to take a no-brainer. This is how you can be [[_Notes/Set up yourself for success\|Set up yourself for success]].

Start with the part you find easiest to get going. [[_Notes/Make it easy\|Make it easy]].

Exercise your [[critical thinking\|critical thinking]] to understand how you can make what you need to do so simple that you *cannot not do it*.
## Follow your interest, you curiosity, your mind
You're at your best when you're having fun , are excited by and are enjoying what you do. [[_Notes/To keep going, you must do what is fun and enjoyable\|To keep going, you must do what is fun and enjoyable]]. [[_Notes/The best learning is when you have fun\|The best learning is when you have fun]]. And one of the best way to enjoy what you do is to go with the flow. So to do your best work, go with the flow.

You're not going with the flow when you're forcing yourself or things. If you're [[_Notes/Trying hard\|Trying hard]] against your inner desire, you're not 80/20, you're against the flow.

Solutions not to force against yourself:
- Forget about what you think you should do, if you don't want to do it, and do something else.
- Change your [[environment\|environment]] and find a way to get into the mood of doing what you want to do.
- Do it at a different time, when you'll be in the right [[_Notes/Mind modes\|Mind modes]].
- Choose how you're going to do it, apply [[_Notes/Embrace constraints\|constraints]], reduce the scope,
## [[_Notes/Taking the time to do things well\|Take your time]]
Going with the flow also means *not hurrying*. Doing the things just at the right pace. Doing things too fast is a sign of focusing [[_Notes/Improvement over results\|on the result]] rather than [[Resources/MoCs/On the process MoC\|the process]].
If you're in a hurry, it's precisely [[_Notes/When you should not want to be doing things\|When you should not want to be doing things]].
