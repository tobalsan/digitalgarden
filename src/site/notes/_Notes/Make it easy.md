# Make it easy
What do you want to achieve? 
Humans are driven by curiosity and progress. If you're stagnating, you're as much dead as alive. 
So if you are aching for something, good, it means you're fully alive. 
Now, you might be struggling. The goal you are aiming for might look  distant to you. This is exactly what creates the angst and anxiety inside of you. It's this very anxiety that shuts off your creativity and awareness necessary to evolve and keep going to finally reach your goal. 
So, does this mean you are stuck? Are you doomed to be miserable? Is your only hope waiting for the magical, miracle hollywood moment where suddenly everything falls in place? 

I posit that the key to moving forward in life is to *make things easy*.

A lot of things definitively won't be easy. But there are ways to make certain things easier. So why the hell would you put up with difficult stuff all the time? 
You see that's the irony with self-help advice polluting the internet. They tell you you should embrace hardships and embrace difficulty. To some extent, it's true. When you can't do anything about it, just pull your sleeves up, and get to work. But mindlessly brute-forcing your way through a task, or worse, intentionally making things difficult, is pure retardation.

All the behavior we judge as unproductive, or downright toxic, is often easy to implement. Drinking, binge watching TV shows, eating junk food, masturbating, procrastinating on our phones, etc. The cost of doing them is practically non-existent and they procure an immediate reward to the brain. No wonder it is so hard to stop doing them. Or is it? 
If you didn't have the time to do these things, don't you think it would be easier to stop indulging in these activities?

Oddly, whenever we think of doing productive activities, we immediately conjure images of willpower, discipline, and hardships. Why? Why does running, working out, reading, meditating, writing, learning a new skill, and improving oneself in general, have to feel hard right at the onset? 
I'm not sure if it's due to a natural side-effect, our society, our culture, our upbringing, genetic disposition, or a mix of all of them. But I believe that with just a bit of reflection—it's important to [[_Notes/Spend time in reflection every day\|stop sometimes and just think and assess what's going on in your life]] and where you're heading—anyone can find a way to make doing the right things *easy* for them. 

It's just that most of the time, we unconsciously follow the models fed on us by the world. 
You want to workout? You have to go to the gym 3 times per week, dangling heavy dumbells, and pay attention to your diet.
You want to learn a skill? You have to sit learning for hours. Who cares if it's boring, you have to follow the designed course.
You want to read a book? You have to sit and read it linearly from start to finish. Oh, and you must read for at least 30 minutes, otherwise it's not useful.

If you think these rules are silly and no one applies them, think again. These rules are seldom voiced clearly by anyone, but everyone subconsciously follow them most of the time.

What about curiosity? Where is the enjoyment? Why don't we start with what is fun first?
When was the last time when you had to force yourself to do something that made you curious, or that you thoroughly enjoyed? 
## Find the pull
The things you want to be doing should pull you to them, not push you away.
As soon as you feel a push from the activity you know you should be doing , stop right away and think about it for a couple minutes. Why do you feel like you should be doing it, yet you seem to *not* want to do it? 

You can use the 2-minute rule, which bypasses the initial friction. But it's just a hack. While it can be useful sometimes, it may be detrimental if used all the time.
There might be a more profound issue in the way you approach things. 
If everything you think of or want to be doing feels like a chore, then every day will suck, and in the end your life will feel boring. It's probably a sign you're doing thins just as means to an end, exactly [[_Notes/When you should not want to be doing things\|When you should not want to be doing things]]. And while many things we do in life are just means to an end, living your whole life every day doing things just for an end result is a surefire way to NOT be happy.

So whenever you think of doing something but somehow can't feel the *pull* to do it, ask yourself why. Why do I want it done, but don't want to do it? 
From there, new paths will emerge. 
The first step is to stop and reflect upon about what think you should be doing. 
Then, instead of doing it like it's supposed to be done, try to come up with ways to make it easy. Maybe you can find a more fun and engaging way to do it. Or, you can make it shorter, quicker, or simpler. Think about ways you could do it differently than you first assumed. 
Or even question whether you really have to do it. Can you enjoy the process, or are you just after the result? If you're after the result, is there another way you can get to that result? 
The goal is to [[_Notes/Trying hard\|stop hitting your head against a brick wall]]. Stop forcing, [[_Notes/Don't try - objectives do rarely work\|stop trying hard]].
