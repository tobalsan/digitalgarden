# Choosing a goal means accepting everything that comes with it
Choosing a goal means accepting the context of it, its requirements, environment, and conditions.

Too often in the past, I've made the mistake of picking a goal and just wanting the result, not all the other things it entails: the places, the people, the sacrifices, the efforts.
When choosing a goal, **make sure to actually accept everything that comes with it**, not just the pleasant idea of the result.
