# Set up yourself for success
Discipline, motivation, willpower: when striving for a goal, we tend to use brute force. That's laziness—lazy thinking—disguised as hard work.
"Be like water" said Bruce Lee. "When the water is poured into a cup, it becomes the cup. When poured into a bowl, it becomes the bowl."
**It's about going with the flow, not against**.
It's about not resisting to what is. It its accepting reality, the universe. And adapting to it. **Adaptation** is the key word.
- Don't get married to ideas and position. It stifles adaptation and evolution.
- Don't fixate on a goal, or even a way of reaching that goal. Embrace reality and deal with it, using what you have, where you are, and what you want now.

Trying hard is being lazy. But being lazy first can lead to smart. 
Instead of trying hard, it's much easier and fun to set yourself for success. How?
