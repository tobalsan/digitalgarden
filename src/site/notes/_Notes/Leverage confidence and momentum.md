# Leverage confidence and momentum

Achieving goals makes you believe you can achieve goals which in turn makes you achieving more goals. It’s a virtuous circle. 
How can you leverage this? By setting small goals and achieving them.

Setting big goals at the outset is counterproductive because you’re likely to feel discouraged, fail, and start learning helplessness, which in turn makes you less motivated and less likely to achieve other goals. It’s a vicious circle.

When you set small achievable goals and grow from there, you start the virtuous circle.
Pick a simple goal, and achieve it. You gain confidence, and in turn get motivated to do it again, and more. So do it again, with a goal a little bigger. Then repeat. The more you'll do it, the more momentum you'll have, and the more unstoppable you'll be.
