# 10 Key Concepts to Use Obsidian

```toc
```

## 1. Balance System Setup and Real Work
Many users spend excessive time configuring templates, plugins, and other advanced features instead of using the system for actual work. 

- **Example**: Users often focus on perfecting templates for meeting notes or daily journals. Dan warns that such activities can become procrastination. Be mindful of this and ensure time spent tweaking systems doesn’t replace productive work.

---

## 2. Build Systems with a Purpose
A system in Obsidian should include three key components:
- **Map of Content (MOC)**: An index that organizes related notes.
- **Templates**: Customizable formats for consistent and quick note creation.
- **Data View Tables**: A feature to link and display notes within the system.

- **Example**: To manage meeting notes, create an MOC labeled “Meeting Notes.” Link it to templates for new meeting notes and use data view tables to automatically list all meeting notes by date.

---

## 3. Adapt Systems to Your Natural Workflow
Systems should evolve from your work habits rather than being predefined. Start with basic notes and develop a system based on actual usage patterns.

- **Example**: Start by jotting down project-related notes. As you notice recurring patterns (e.g., tasks, deadlines), refine these into a project system with templates and MOCs.

---

## 4. Make Notes Usable
Taking notes is easy, but revisiting them is challenging. Adopt strategies to ensure notes are reviewed and used.

- **Example**: Implement a weekly review process to revisit key notes or use Obsidian's random note feature to rediscover older notes.

---

## 5. Design Systems for Productivity Cycles
Dan acknowledges that productivity ebbs and flows. Systems should accommodate these cycles, making it easy to resume work after breaks.

- **Example**: Create "onboarding notes" for your future self, simplifying the process of resuming work after downtime.

---

## 6. Treat Notes as a Living Knowledge Base
Avoid treating notes as static archives. Continuously update, rewrite, and refine notes to keep them relevant.

- **Example**: Edit old notes to reflect new insights or improved clarity. Treat notes as living documents that grow over time.

---

## 7. Generate Ideas by Combining Insights
New ideas often emerge by connecting existing ones. Cross-reference notes to create novel insights.

- **Example**: Take notes from two articles with differing viewpoints and explore their intersections to develop unique perspectives.

---

## 8. Writing as a Tool for Thinking
Writing isn't just a means to document thoughts but a method to refine and deepen them.

- **Example**: Begin drafting ideas even if they're incomplete. Writing exposes knowledge gaps and clarifies understanding.

---

## 9. Publish Your Work
Publishing forces you to create polished, structured outputs, which clarifies thinking and boosts visibility.

- **Example**: Start a blog or publish summaries of your learning. Even if readership is low, this practice helps you organize your thoughts.

---

## 10. Mimic Experts for Success
Studying and emulating experts in your field is a shortcut to learning.

- **Example**: Observe how experienced users structure their notes and systems. Mimic their design of MOCs or plugin usage for efficiency.

## Conclusion
By following these detailed tips and examples, you can transform your note-taking practices into a powerful tool for creativity, productivity, and learning.
