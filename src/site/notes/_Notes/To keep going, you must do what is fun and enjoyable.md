# To keep going, you must do what is fun and enjoyable
What makes thinks fun and enjoyable? Discovery, Challenge, and Progress.
- Discovery: follow your curiosity. Do things for the sake of doing them, not an ulterior reward.
- Challenge: what you set out to do must be in the sweet spot between feasibility and difficulty. The golidlocks zone, where you're not too bored by what you do but it's also not too hard to make you give up.
- Progress: you must continually improve and evolve, understand and unlocking new stuff as you go. If you keep stagnating, you'll get bored and give up.
