# The Progress Dichotomy Active vs Passive state

Reading [[Reference/William Zinsser - Writing to Learn\|William Zinsser - Writing to Learn]], he wrote about writing being a [physical] active process, as opposed to reading, which is passive.
This prompted me to think about how the brain really works. Real learning [understanding] occurs when you are active. Learning is a physically active process, not a passive one. Thus, when you just read or watch a video, you are not learning anything. Not until you enter an active process—like writing, teaching, putting things into practice—your brain really integrates knowledge. 
Integrating knowledge is a form of progress, and any kind of progress requires an active state:
- improving your mindset, mental, and models,
- implementing a new habit,
- behavior modification,
- getting fit or improving at a sport,
- becoming a better person,
- growing your social network,
- any craft, work, or artistic occupation.
These are not something you choose to be once. They are active processes. All of these only become real when you are actively doing something about it. Otherwise it remains unfulfilled potential.
Active process means repetition and consistency. There is no  progress [growth] possible without them. Sport, craft, learning, and life are not one-time events, they're processes. 
In sports, crafts, and artistic skills, it's generally obvious that an active process is required to progress. But other endeavours aren't as obvious.
Take journaling, which is a form of writing. Even though writing in your journal is a physical process, you need to go regularly over your journal and reflect upon it to get the benefits of it. Any kind of [good] writing requires going back over what was written, to rewrite, [[Resources/MoCs/Simplify MoC\|Simplify MoC]], remove—in other words improve—what has been written. It is writing's organic growth.
The same goes for reading. Just reading a book doesn't mean you automatically obtain the knowledge it contains. There's no such thing as automatic transfer of knowledge. To get the best of a book, you must highlight it, write about it, talk about it, and put its principles into practice. New knowledge grows inside your brain as it dances with it.
