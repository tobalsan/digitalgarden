# Things get accomplished by iteration
Habits, repetition, process. Going over what you do and refine. 
But:
- Chasing the new, shiny, exciting,
- wanting to have things sorted out once and for all,
- desiring to hit the target at the first attempt,

all of these present a big problem: you do something once and stop. You don't iterate, you don't go over what you did and don't refine. How are you supposed to improve like this?

Instead of trying to do everything at once, try [[Archive/You don't have to spend hours on each task\|You don't have to spend hours on each task]]. Take things [[Archive/One day at a time\|One day at a time]].

Keep in mind that analysis of past action, reflection, is required for progress. [[Archive/Act fast, then take the time to reflect\|Act fast, then take the time to reflect]]. [[Archive/Spend time in reflection every day\|Spend time in reflection every day]]. Otherwise you'll keep [[Archive/repeating mistakes\|repeating mistakes]]. Iteration implies evolution, not mindless repetition.
