# It is context that makes things matter
Our brains seem to work in contexts, which makes sense since the brain works primarily with connections. And context fosters connections. 
This is why we quickly remember things when in the right context, and why it is so hard to recall stuff when not in context.

The problem with the abundance of information on the internet, apps, and notification on our smartphones, is they present information out of context most of the time. Worse, they take us out of our current context. [[Archive/Technology fucks up focus\|Technology fucks up focus]].

We also often use our digital tools clumsily, mimicking the filing cabinet/archiving methodology when dealing with data and communication. For instance:
- We gather things under theme tags.
- We have Slack channels dedicated to general themes (like development, customer support, events).

Instead, we would gain more clarity by organizing things by context. I like the [Twist](https://twistapp.com/)  app for that. A better way to organize communication is to do it around specific, contextual topics, rather that general, overarching ones.
## The town square and the workshop
We don't *always* have to put things in context. There are moments where casual and random subjects can be thrown around without any precise context. Imagine a town square, where people meet and chat about everything and nothing. 
Then there are workshops, were people work on a specific topic. They focus on a mission. 

The problem is when we mix the two. We treat as a town square discussion what should belong inside a workshop. 
## Context and timing are all that matter
No matter who you are, what you do, how you look, the result of actions is dependent on **context** and **timing**.

You can do the right things at the wrong time and you end up failing. On the other hand, you can mess up and still get away, depending on the context and timing.

Let's say you blurt out a random joke. Depending on the context—who you’re with, the general mood of the room you’re in, how other perceive you—it could be an instant success. Someone else—or even the same person—spits out the exact same joke, but the audience is different, people are tired, they don’t have much energy, and it’s crickets.

So don’t be too hard on yourself if you fail, mess up, or get rejected. It might not be you or what you do, but just not the right time or context.  Keep in mind it’s not an excuse for being a lazy ass. It’s still up to you to identify the right context and find the right timing for your endeavors. But it's  something to remind ourselves to avoid [[Archive/Don't try - objectives do rarely work\|trying too hard]].
